# LaunchPad Showcase

An independent Vite + React microsite that lives at `/projects/showcase-project/` once the root build runs.

```bash
npm run dev --workspace showcase-project
npm run build --workspace showcase-project
```

Use this folder as a template for future standalone projects—duplicate the directory, update the entry in
`scripts/build-all.mjs`, and point a new card inside the personal site's Projects tab to the new path.*** End Patch
